## Notes
- Hero H1 contains 4 inline strong-anchor links — keep them inline for SEO keyword density (per `mem://seo/internal-linking-system`).
- Stats counter currently shows "0+" placeholders on the live site; treat numbers as TBD content.
- "Recent Videos" loads dynamically (live site shows "Loading videos..."); the 7 listed are the latest snapshot.
- All `https://drarefin.com/<keyword-slug>` links inside body text are SEO satellite pages on the original site. In the React build, route them to the closest internal page (`/about/`, `/treatment/`, `/contact/`) — do NOT replicate 30+ satellite routes. Strong-anchor wrappers must be preserved.
